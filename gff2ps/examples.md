## Examples

`gff2ps` has achieved another genome landmark. The mosquito genome annotation for five chromosome arms (2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, and X) has been summarized into a two-sided five-pages foldout included as the **figure 1** of "The Genome Sequence of the Malaria Mosquito *Anopheles gambiae*" [Holt et al. *Science* 298(5591):129-149 (2002)](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/298/5591/129). Both foldout sides can be downloaded as PDF files from Science’s website at the "[Annotation of the *Anopheles gambiae* genome sequence](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/298/5591/129/DC2)" poster page. You can also download a printable version of this figure from the following links:

We have performed the map of the Human Genome with `gff2ps`. The 22 autosomic, X, and Y chromosomes were displayed in a big poster appearing as the **figure 1** of "The Sequence of the Human Genome" [Venter et al. *Science* 291(5507):1304-1351 (2001)](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/291/5507/1304). The single chromosome pictures can be accessed to visualize the web version of the "[Annotation of the Celera Human Genome Assembly](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5507/1304/DC2)" poster. A printable version of this figure is also available from the following links:

- [10Mb gzipped PDF file](http://genome.crg.es/references/genome_maps/2001_Science_v291_i5507_p1304_fig1_HumanGenome.pdf.gz) (±107x150cm).

We participated in [GASP](http://www.fruitfly.org/GASP1/), whose results appeared in *Genome Research* on April 24th. `gff2ps` generated the poster summarizing all the submitted predictions on the *Adh* region 2.9Mbp genomic sequence. These results are analyzed in "Genome Annotation Assessment in *Drosophila melanogaster*" [Reese et al. *Genome Research* 10(4):483-501 (2000)](http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/4/483).

`gff2ps` was used to plot each chromosome arm of *Drosophila melanogaster* (X, 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, and 4) in the "[Coding content of the fly genome](http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/genomes/2000/drosophila.shl)" figure, included as a poster in "The Genome Sequence of *Drosophila melanogaster*" [Adams et al. *Science* 287(5461):2185-2195 (2000)](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/5461/2185).

A previous version of `gff2ps` (0.90) was used to generate a three-page poster for ISMB'99's [tutorial #3](http://whitefly.lbl.gov/GASP1/tutorial/presentationFramed/ppframe.htm) on "*Drosophila melanogaster* ADH region annotation experiment (GASP1)". You can download the [poster](ftp://genome.crg.es/pub/software/gff_tools/gff2ps/poster/) or view the [pictures from ISMB'99](http://genome.crg.es/~jabril/PHOTOS/ADHposterISMB99.html).
