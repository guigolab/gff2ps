## How To

In this section, you can find useful tutorials on how to use `gff2ps`. It will be regularly updated with new documents.

- **[Comparing sources with `gff2ps`](gff2ps_docs/comp_sources/index.html)**:  
  One of the [gff2ps](http://genome.crg.es/software/gfftools/GFF2PS.html) program's strengths is comparing results from different sources, allowing you to easily see differences among genomic sequence annotations and results from one or more gene prediction programs, including results from programs like `blast`.

- **[Visualizing PostScript output from `gff2ps`](gff2ps_docs/visualizing/index.html)**:  
  The [gff2ps](http://genome.crg.es/software/gfftools/GFF2PS.html) and [gff2aplot](http://genome.crg.es/software/gfftools/GFF2APLOT.html) programs produce PostScript plots. In this how-to, we provide help on handling PostScript output and converting it to other formats (including bitmaps and PDF).

- **Using `gff2ps` to visualize gene predictions from `geneid`**:  
  The following book chapter describes a protocol to run `geneid` ([geneid homepage](http://genome.crg.es/software/geneid/)) on DNA sequences and explains many of its features. Several command-line examples show how to process gene prediction results and plot them with `gff2ps`.
