## Introduction

`gff2ps` is a program for visualizing annotations of genomic sequences. The program takes as input the annotated features on a genomic sequence in `GFF` format, and produces a visual output in PostScript. It can be used in a very simple way, because it assumes that the `GFF` file itself carries enough formatting information, but it also allows, through a number of options and/or a configuration file, a great degree of customization.

We would appreciate it if you could cite the `gff2ps` paper and/or the URL as follows:
